## üìù Rules

Try to sovle each program by using python for simplicity and understanding of innerworkings of the code. To make practicing more challenging and fun, I‚Äôve implemented a **programming language randomizer**. Here are the rules:

1. **Random Language Selection**  
   - Before solving a problem, run the `randomize_language.cpp` program.  
   - The output will determine **which programming language** you must use to solve the next problem.  
   - Only the generated language is allowed for that problem.

2. **Difficulty Levels**  
   - Problems are categorized into three levels:  
     - **Easy**  
     - **Medium**  
     - **Hard**  
   - Choose problems from each level according to your practice plan.

3. **One Problem, One Solution**  
   - Each problem must have **only one solution file** per programming language.  
   - Name your solution files clearly, e.g., `two_sum_python.cpp`, `two_sum_java.java`.

4. **Commit Guidelines**  
   - Include the **problem link** in a comment at the top of each solution file.  
   - Include a **brief explanation** of your approach if needed.
